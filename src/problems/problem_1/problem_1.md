# PROBLEM 1

sort list a numberically, sort list to the same way

## list of numbers

- a: [3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
- b: [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]

b is tied to order of a

both lists must be seperate, but correlated.

## solution:
- a
    - [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7]
- b
    1. [b, c, a, d, e, f, g]
    2. [c, b, d, a, e, f, g]
